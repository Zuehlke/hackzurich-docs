* [Alexa Skills Set](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)

    * Alexa is Amazon’s voice service and the brain behind millions of devices like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and [Echo Show](https://developer.amazon.com/echo-show). Alexa provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to create a more personalized experience. There are now [more than 15,000 skills](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b/ref=skillsrw_surl?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011) from companies like Starbucks, Uber, and Capital One as well as other innovative designers and developers

    * With the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), designers, developers, and brands can build engaging skills and reach millions of customers. ASK is a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation, and code samples that makes it fast and easy for you to add skills to Alexa. With ASK, you can leverage Amazon’s knowledge and pioneering work in the field of voice design.

* [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service)

    * Use the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) to add intelligent voice control to any connected product that has a microphone and speaker. Your customers will be able to ask Alexa to play music, answer questions, get news and local information, control smart home products, and more on their voice-enabled products.

* [Authorizing from a Companion App (Android/iOS)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/authorizing-your-alexa-enabled-product-from-an-android-or-ios-mobile-app)

    * To access the Alexa Voice Service (AVS), your Alexa-enabled product needs to obtain a Login with Amazon (LWA) access token, which is sent with each request to AVS. If your product lacks a graphical user interface (GUI), also known as headless, you do this by integrating a companion app with the LWA Mobile SDK for Android or iOS. Your companion app is responsible for obtaining an authorization code and securely transferring it to your product. Your product is responsible for using the authorization code to obtain access and refresh tokens from LWA, which are used to make calls to AVS

# IFTTT

* [Alexa](https://ifttt.com/amazon_alexa)

    * The shortfall of Alexa's IFTTT integration is the lack of any actions whatsoever. Alexa can only be used as a trigger in IFTTT. That means I can't, for example, complete a task in Todoist and have Alexa play a song. Or as editor Ry Crist suggested, you can't have Alexa play sound bites, such as a dog barking, when motion is detected or a door opens in the middle of the night.
